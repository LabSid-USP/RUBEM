Piracicaba River Basin (PRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Piracicaba River Basin is located in the southeastern portion of Brazil in a continental plateau regime.

Ipojuca River Basin (IRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ipojuca River Basin is located in northeastern Brazil in a transitional region where the headwaters have a more arid regime and the mouth of the coast.

The route of the Ipojuca River, with about 320 km, oriented in the west-east direction, with its fluvial regime intermittent, becoming perennial from its medium course, in the areas of the city of Caruaru.

Its main tributaries, on the right bank, are Liberal stream, Taquara stream and Mel stream and, on the left bank, Coutinho stream, Mocós stream, Muxoxo stream and Pata Choca stream. Liberal creek, its most important tributary, has its sources in the municipality of Alagoinha. It drains along its 47km of extension, areas of the municipalities of Alagoinha, Pesqueira and Sanharó, and flows into the Ipojuca river.The basin provides an expressive portion of the water consumed in the metropolitan area of Recife.
