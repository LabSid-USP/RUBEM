Paraíba do Sul River Basin (PSRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Paraiba do Sul is located in the South-East region of Brazil, been one of the most significant river basins in terms of urban water supply. This interstate basin forms part of the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and covers an area of 55,500 :raw-html:`km<sup>2</sup>`. An interconnected system of dams in the area are responsible for the water supply of Rio de Janeiro City system, and a transposition to Cantareira System in São Paulo.

Upper Iguaçu River Basin (UIRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upper Iguaçu basin is located in the south portion of Brazil. The Iguaçu River is a tributary of the Paraná River and is also the longest river in the state of Paraná. It is formed by the meeting of the Iraí and Atuba rivers, in the eastern part of the Paraná municipality of Curitiba. Among the main tributaries are: Itaqui, Piraquara, Atuba, Palmital, Barigui, Miringuava, Passaúna and Verde rivers. The basin provides the water consumed in the metropolitan area of Curitiba.

Piracicaba River Basin (PRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Piracicaba River Basin is located in the southeastern portion of Brazil in a continental plateau regime. The Piracicaba River is a tributary of the Tietê River, and is an interstate river as some sources of the rivers that make up its basin are found in the State of Minas Gerais. The Piracicaba river basin is formed by the sub-basins of the Jaguari, Atibaia, Piracicaba, Camanducaia and Corumbataí rivers. Three important dams located at the basin, provide an expressive portion of the water consumed in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo.

Ipojuca River Basin (IRB)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Ipojuca River Basin is located in northeastern Brazil in a transitional region where the headwaters have a more arid regime and the mouth of the coast.

The route of the Ipojuca River, with about 320 km, oriented in the west-east direction, with its fluvial regime intermittent, becoming perennial from its medium course, in the areas of the city of Caruaru.

Its main tributaries, on the right bank, are Liberal stream, Taquara stream and Mel stream and, on the left bank, Coutinho stream, Mocós stream, Muxoxo stream and Pata Choca stream. Liberal creek, its most important tributary, has its sources in the municipality of Alagoinha. It drains along its 47km of extension, areas of the municipalities of Alagoinha, Pesqueira and Sanharó, and flows into the Ipojuca river.The basin provides an expressive portion of the water consumed in the metropolitan area of Recife.
