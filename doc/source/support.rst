.. note::

    As with most open-source projects, the folks on these channels are volunteers. If nobody has answered your question, it may be because nobody can understand the question, or it may be that everybody that can help is busy.

You can also try asking at `rubem.hydrological+support@labsid.eng.br <mailto:rubem.hydrological+support@labsid.eng.br>`__. But please don’t post your question in all two channels in quick succession.
